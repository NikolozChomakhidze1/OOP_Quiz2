#  OOP Quiz #2 - Java List Transformation

##  Package
`oop.q2`

##  Description
This Java program solves Quiz #2 of the Object-Oriented Programming course.

It uses two predefined lists:
- `list1`: A list of integers  
- `list2`: A list of strings  

The goal is to generate a third list, `list3`, using a pattern:

**index = value_from_list1 + (value_from_list1 - 1)**

This index is then used to fetch an element from `list2`. If the index is out of bounds, the program handles it safely.

The program is flexible and works with any valid values in `list1` and `list2`.

##  Features
- Generates a new list based on a mathematical pattern
- Works with any valid input lists
- Gracefully handles invalid indexes
- Clean, readable, and modular code

## Sample Output
Generated list3:
